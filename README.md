# Election-Analysis
Using the power of Python to automate the vote counting process for a local election

Tasked with helping Tom, a Colorado board of election employee, to perform an election audit of the tabulated results for US congressional precints in Colorado. We need to report:
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Automating the process using Python need to account for the below counting methods:
- Mail In Ballots which are **hand counted**
- Punch Card ballots which are **machine counted**
- and, DRE machine ballots which are **computer counted**
All three of these methods will help determine the election results and certify the election.
