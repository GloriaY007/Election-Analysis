# Election-Analysis
Using the power of Python to automate the vote counting process for a local election

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee (Tom) has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent congressional election.
We need to report:
1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: [election_results.csv](https://github.com/GloriaY007/Election-Analysis/blob/main/election_results.csv).
- Software: Python 3.9.1 64-bit, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of teh election show that:
- There were "**369,711**" votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
  
- The candidates results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received "**23.0%**" of the vote and "**85,213**" number of votes
  - Diana DeGette received "**13.8%**" of the vote and "**272,892**" number of votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received  "**3.1%**" of the vote and "**11,606**" number of votes

- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette who received "**13.8%**" of the vote and "**272,892**" number of votes
  
 ## Challenge and Overview
  
 ## Challenge and Summary
 
Automating the process using Python need to account for the below counting methods:
- Mail In Ballots which are **hand counted**
- Punch Card ballots which are **machine counted**
- and, DRE machine ballots which are **computer counted**
All three of these methods will help determine the election results and certify the election.
